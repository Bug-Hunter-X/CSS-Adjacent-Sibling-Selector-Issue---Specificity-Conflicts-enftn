# CSS Adjacent Sibling Selector and Specificity Issue

This repository demonstrates a common CSS error involving the adjacent sibling combinator (`+`) and potential specificity conflicts.  The `bug.css` file shows the incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.

The problem arises from a misunderstanding of the adjacent sibling selector and how it interacts with other selectors.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` (which you'll need to create) in a browser.
3. Observe the unexpected styling behavior.
4. Compare it with the corrected behavior in `bugSolution.css`.

## Solution
The solution involves correcting the selector to address the sibling issue or increase the specificity of the rule to resolve conflict issues.  The solution involves using appropriate selectors based on the intended styling behavior and potentially adding more specificity if necessary.
