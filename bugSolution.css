To fix this, we can use the general sibling combinator (`~`) which selects all following siblings:

```css
.my-element:hover ~ .sibling-element {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

Or, if we only want to style direct children of a parent element, we can use a more specific selector:

```css
.parent-element:hover .my-element ~ .sibling-element {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

Also, always check for specificity conflicts. If the above doesn't work, investigate which styles have higher specificity and adjust them accordingly.  Consider using the `!important` flag as a last resort to override specificity, but be mindful of the potential drawbacks of using `!important`.
